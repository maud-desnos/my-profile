				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hi, my name is Maud, I am eighteen and I am a first year BBA student at ESSEC . I grew up in Garches (a small town next to Paris) with my big sister, Manon, and my parents</p>

				<h2>Travelling</h2>
				<p>I love discovering the world, learning about new cultures and languages. Thanks to my parents who love travelling as well, I had the opportunity to go to many different countries and I even had the chance to travel alone: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>to a summer camp in the United States</li>
					<li>to Australia in a host family (twice)</li>
					<li>to South Africa on a humanitarian mission</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Water sports</h2>
				<p>My parents are passionate about water sports. They have both been windsurfing since they were young and they recently learned to kitesurf, at the same time as my sister and me. They are the ones who transmitted to me this love of the ocean, kitesurfing, surfing and diving.</p>

				<h2>Extracurricular activities</h2>
				<p>Extracurricular activities have always helped me de-stress and expend my energy at the end of a day of classes. I started dancing when I was only 2 years old. Ballet and modern-jazz dance. At the age of 13, I stopped dancing to start gymnastics, I did one year in leisure and then 3 years in competition. Unfortunately I stopped gymnastics (great regret today). Now I just play sports at home and volleyball, with the ESSEC volleyball association!</p>
